/// Flag Finder

I have a list of country name in drop down list. when we select any country name that country flag will display.

Initially I passed the country name and flag image url in node and I fetch that data in react js using axios.
I set that data into country.
initially I set default country name and flag image.
using map I display the list of country in drop down.
when I select any one option the onchange event will happen.
In onchange event I reset the country name and flag image.
